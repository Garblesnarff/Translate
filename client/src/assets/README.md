# Assets Directory

## Purpose

This directory serves as a central location for storing static assets used by the client application. These assets can include images, fonts, icons, and other media files that are part of the application's user interface or content.

## Important Files/Directories

- **`fonts/`**: This subdirectory contains font files used for text rendering throughout the application. See the `README.md` within the `fonts/` directory for more specific details on its contents and usage.
- Other static files like images (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) or global mock data (e.g., `.json`) might also be organized here in respective subdirectories.

## Interaction

The assets stored in this directory are referenced and utilized by the client-side code. This includes JavaScript/TypeScript components, CSS stylesheets, and HTML templates. For example, images are displayed, fonts are applied to text, and icons are rendered as part of the user interface.

## Usage

Assets are typically referenced by their path relative to the `src` directory or directly within the `assets` directory, depending on the build configuration and how the client application handles static files.

For example:

- In a CSS file (assuming it's processed by a bundler that understands relative paths from `src`):
  ```css
  .logo {
    background-image: url('/assets/images/logo.png');
  }
  ```

- In a JavaScript/TypeScript component (using an import that might be processed by a bundler):
  ```typescript
  import myImage from '@/assets/images/my-image.svg';
  // or
  // const myImage = require('@/assets/images/my-image.svg');

  function MyComponent() {
    return <img src={myImage} alt="My descriptive image" />;
  }
  ```

- For fonts, they are often declared in CSS via `@font-face` rules pointing to files within the `assets/fonts/` directory, or loaded by a specific font-loading utility.

Ensure that the paths used to reference assets are correct according to your project's setup and build process.
