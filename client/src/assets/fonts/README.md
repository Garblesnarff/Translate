# Fonts Directory

## Purpose

This directory is intended to store font files used in the client application. These fonts are essential for rendering text consistently across different user devices.

## Important Files

As of the last update, no specific font files (e.g., `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.woff`, `.woff2`) are present in this directory.

Please add the required font files here. Examples of what might be included:

- `Inter-Bold.ttf`
- `Inter-Regular.ttf`
- `YourCustomFont-Medium.otf`

## Interaction

The fonts stored in this directory are loaded and utilized by the client application. The application's rendering engine will use these fonts to display text elements, ensuring a consistent and desired typographic experience for the user.

## Usage

These fonts are typically referenced in CSS files (e.g., using `@font-face` rules) or loaded dynamically by a font loader utility within the application. Ensure that the paths in your CSS or font loader are correctly pointing to the font files in this directory.

For example, in a CSS file:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('./Inter-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('./Inter-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: bold;
  font-style: normal;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

Or when using a font loading utility, you might configure it to look for fonts within this `assets/fonts` path.
