# UI Components Directory

## Purpose

This directory houses reusable User Interface (UI) components that form the building blocks of the client application's visual presentation. These components are often based on a UI library or framework (e.g., Shadcn/UI, Material-UI, Ant Design) and are styled and configured for consistent use across the application.

The primary goal is to promote consistency, reusability, and maintainability in the application's UI layer.

## Important Files

This directory contains various individual UI component files. Each file typically represents a distinct UI element. Examples include:

- `button.tsx`
- `card.tsx`
- `dialog.tsx`
- `input.tsx`
- `select.tsx`
- `table.tsx`
- `tabs.tsx`
- ... and many others.

Each component is self-contained, defining its structure, styling (often via utility classes or a theming system), and behavior.

## Interaction

These UI components are designed to be imported and used throughout the client application wherever their specific functionality or visual representation is needed. They are built to be composable, meaning they can be combined to create more complex UI structures.

By using these shared components, we ensure a consistent look and feel across different parts of the application and reduce code duplication.

## Usage

Components from this directory are typically imported into other components or pages. Here's a simple example of how you might import and use the `Button` component:

```typescript jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"; // Assuming an alias '@' is configured for the 'src' directory

// Inside another React component or page:
function MyPageComponent() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
      <p>This is an example of using a shared UI component.</p>
      <Button onClick={handleClick} variant="outline" size="lg">
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyPageComponent;
```

Refer to the specific component's implementation or associated documentation (if any) for details on its available props and variants.
The import path might vary based on project configuration (e.g., usage of path aliases like `@/`).
