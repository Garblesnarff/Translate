{"translatedText":"# The Deeds of the Descendants of the Great Translator Jamyang Kunga Sodnam\n\nThe practice of following the unsurpassed ones should be diligently pursued.  To briefly describe the manner in which we have learned this from our revered spiritual masters, the virtuous preceptors:  The essence of the Buddha's teachings is encapsulated in the three vows.  Thus, the manner in which the vow of individual liberation is progressively imparted is as follows:\n\nAt the age of eleven, in the year of the Wood-Rooster, during the auspicious sixth month, on a favorable day, the disciple received the complete lay vows from the venerable Jampa Sodnam Lhungrub, the excellent source of blessings, the glorious banner, in the presence of the great teacher.  He also undertook the monastic vows.  At the end of that year, in the month of the King, on the twelfth day of the waxing moon, shortly before noon, in the presence of the supreme guide, the compassionate one, the embodiment of immeasurable qualities of body, speech, and mind, the one known as Vajrapani, the Auspicious One, the disciple requested the venerable Jampa Sodnam Lhungrub, the excellent source of blessings, the glorious banner, to be his teacher.  The disciple received the precepts of a novice monk.\n\nAt the age of twenty, in the year of the Wood-Male Rat, on the day of the lion's house, on the 20th of the month of the auspicious moon, in the presence of two elderly monks and one lay person, the disciple received the precepts of a fully ordained monk from the previous teacher, the one who is steadfast in the two aspects of the Bodhisattva mind, the great teacher, the venerable Sangye Rinchen Dpalbzang, who possesses profound wisdom and understanding of all the Buddha's teachings.  He was appointed as the teacher of the esoteric teachings.  The disciple, in the midst of five monks, received the precepts of a fully ordained monk, according to the tradition.\n\nThe lineage is traced back to the fully enlightened Buddha Shakyamuni.
