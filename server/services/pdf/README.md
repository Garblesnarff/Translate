# Server-Side PDF Generation Service

## Purpose

This directory (`server/services/pdf/`) contains modules and classes specifically designed for generating PDF documents on the server-side. This service is responsible for converting structured data into formatted PDF files.

## Important Files

- **`PDFGenerator.ts`**: This TypeScript file exports a class, `PDFGenerator`, which encapsulates the logic for creating PDF documents. It likely uses a library such as `jspdf` or `pdfkit` to handle the low-level PDF construction.

No specific font files (e.g., `.ttf`) or other static assets for PDF generation are stored directly within this directory. If custom fonts are used, `PDFGenerator.ts` would typically load them from a designated server-side assets location or expect them to be available in the server environment.

## Interaction

The `PDFGenerator.ts` class is designed to:
1. Accept structured data as input. This data might include text content, layout information, image paths, and metadata for the PDF.
2. Utilize a PDF generation library (e.g., `jspdf`) to programmatically construct the PDF document. This involves adding pages, setting margins, rendering text with specified fonts and sizes, drawing shapes, and potentially embedding images.
3. Handle font loading and embedding if custom fonts are required for the PDF content (e.g., for specific languages or branding). The paths to these fonts would be configured or passed to the generator.
4. Output the generated PDF, typically as a buffer or stream, which can then be saved to a file or sent directly in an HTTP response.

## Usage

Other server-side modules, such as API route handlers or background job processors, would use the `PDFGenerator` class to create PDF documents dynamically.

**Example (Conceptual):**

```typescript
// In an API route handler or another service module
import PDFGenerator from './services/pdf/PDFGenerator'; // Adjust path as per actual structure
// Or: import { PDFGenerator } from './services/pdf/PDFGenerator'; if not a default export

async function generateReportHandler(request: Request, response: Response) {
  try {
    const reportData = await fetchReportData(); // Fetch data to include in the PDF

    const pdfGenerator = new PDFGenerator({
      // Optional: pass configuration like default fonts, margins, etc.
    });

    // Prepare content for the PDF
    const pdfContent = [
      { type: 'header', text: 'My Report Title', fontSize: 24 },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'This is the introductory paragraph.' },
      // ... more structured content based on reportData
    ];

    // Generate the PDF
    // The actual method name and parameters will depend on PDFGenerator.ts implementation
    const pdfBuffer = await pdfGenerator.generate(pdfContent);

    response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
    response.setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="report.pdf"');
    response.send(pdfBuffer);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to generate PDF:', error);
    response.status(500).send('Error generating PDF report.');
  }
}
```

The specific methods and constructor options for `PDFGenerator` would be defined within `PDFGenerator.ts`. Developers would need to refer to its implementation for detailed usage.
